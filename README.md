## Redirect User to Payment Gateway

```python
from pypep import PasargadPaymentGateway

# Create an object from PasargadPaymentGateway client
# e.q: pasargad = PasargadPaymentGateway(123123,444444,"https://pep.co.ir/ipgtest","cert.xml")
pasargad = PasargadPaymentGateway('<merchant_code>', '<terminal_id>', '<redirect_url>', '<certification_file>')
payment_url = pasargad.redirect(
    amount="15000",
    invoice_number="15001",
    invoice_date="2021/08/23 15:51:00",
    # mobile="091111", #optional
    # email="test@test.local" #optional
)
```

This method, will return a `string` like this:

```bash
// output:
// https://pep.shaparak.ir/payment.aspx?n=LySl+5tYkxL5qNMBRthW7DWzV8e3ALnTJUqiCS0V/io=
// Redirect User to the generated URL to make payment
```

## Checking and Verifying Transaction

After Payment Process, User is going to be returned to your redirect_url

payment gateway is going to answer the payment result with sending below parameters to your redirectURL (
as `QueryString` parameters):

- InvoiceNumber (iN field)
- InvoiceDate (iD field)
- TransactionReferenceID (tref field)

Store this information in a proper data storage and let's check transaction result by sending a check api request to the
Bank:

```python
from pypep import PasargadPaymentGateway

# Create an object from PasargadPaymentGateway client
# e.q: pasargad = PasargadPaymentGateway(123123,444444,"https://pep.co.ir/ipgtest","cert.xml")
pasargad = PasargadPaymentGateway('<merchant_code>', '<terminal_id>', '<redirect_url>', '<certification_file>')

response = pasargad.check_transaction(
    reference_id="637653306794022509",
    invoice_number="15001",
    invoice_date="2021/08/23 15:51:00",
)
```

Successful result:

```json
{
  "TraceNumber": 13,
  "ReferenceNumber": 100200300400500,
  "TransactionDate": "2021/08/08 11:58:23",
  "Action": "1003",
  "TransactionReferenceID": "636843820118990203",
  "InvoiceNumber": "4029",
  "InvoiceDate": "2021/08/08 11:54:03",
  "MerchantCode": 100123,
  "TerminalCode": 200123,
  "Amount": 15000,
  "IsSuccess": true,
  "Message": " "
}
```

If you got `IsSuccess` with `true` value, so everything is O.K!

Now, for your successful transaction, you should call `verifyPayment()` method to keep the money and Bank makes sure the
checking process done properly:

```python
from pypep import Pasargad

# Create an object from Pasargad client
# e.q: pasargad = Pasargad(123123,444444,"https://pep.co.ir/ipgtest","cert.xml")
pasargad = PasargadPaymentGateway('<merchant_code>', '<terminal_id>', '<redirect_url>', '<certification_file>')

response = pasargad.verify_payment(
    amount="15000",
    invoice_number="15001",
    invoice_date="2021/08/23 15:51:00",
)
```

...and the successful response looks like this response:

```json
{
  "IsSuccess": true,
  "Message": " ",
  "MaskedCardNumber": "5022-29**-****-2328",
  "HashedCardNumber": "2DDB1E270C598677AE328AA37C2970E3075E1DB....",
  "ShaparakRefNumber": "100200300400500"
}
```

## Payment Refund

If for any reason, you decided to cancel an order in early hours after taking the order (maximum 2 hours later), you can
refund the client payment to his/her bank card.

for this, use `refund()` method:

```python
from pypep import PasargadPaymentGateway

# Create an object from PasargadPaymentGateway client
# e.q: pasargad = PasargadPaymentGateway(123123,444444,"https://pep.co.ir/ipgtest","cert.xml")
pasargad = PasargadPaymentGateway('<merchant_code>', '<terminal_id>', '<redirect_url>', '<certification_file>')

response = pasargad.refund(
    invoice_number="15001",
    invoice_date="2021/08/23 15:51:00",
)
```
